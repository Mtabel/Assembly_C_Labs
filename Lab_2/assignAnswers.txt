Individual Assignment 1: Segmentation Faults
1. Linej 25 caused the seg fault
2. scanf puts the desired input into a memory location, by not refrencing the memory location a seg fault was created.
3. The Bug is that you dont pass the memory location of sum, thus you cant add to sum outside of the function since it would only pass a value, not memory location.
4. I made it so I pass the memory location of sum with & and add to it within the function as a pointer *sum

Individual Assignment 2: Fix appendTest.c
1.No it did not output like expected. It attempted to append but at the end it prints out odd characters at the end
2.with the fix in Q1; adding a terminating character, it has solved this quesiton.
3.The output is not what I expected, when we write str1: Hello! How are you? - there is only enough characters for that one string, thus it runs over the next thing in memory, str2 array.
