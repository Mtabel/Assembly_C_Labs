    TPS 1: 
    How Memory is Used

1. Static and Global memory memory pool: stores static and global memory for the entirety of the program.
    Stack memory: Stores local variables and function parameters. It it created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.
    Heap memory: Stores dynamically allocated variables using malloc. Exist until explicittly freed with free().

2.  a. 3 variables are declared.
    b.two of them are pointers - ptr in an integer pointer 4 bytes if not packed; handle is a pointer to a pointer THAT WILL CONTAIN... an int
    c. num is stored in the stack, ptr and handle are both found in the heap since they are pointers and handled as such. yeah.
    d. By Line 12 will be pointing to the stack memory from the heap since num is a stack var.
3. Drawed
4. Fine, Drawing Some more

    TPS 2:
    Structures in C 

1.  this Structure defines a node that carries an int and float value, as well as a refrence to another node to define the next one in a chain. Essential the beggining of a linked list.
2. Okay Done
3. Structures seemed to be stored in the stack and are only initialized when asked for by the computer; ACTING like stack memory.
the head and its destination's relationship is a linked list, where the next node is the head of the next and so on and so forth.
