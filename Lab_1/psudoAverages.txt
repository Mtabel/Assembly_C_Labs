Main --------------

create array called numbers
initialize an int called count

for each index in numbers set value to zero
end for

for each number in numbers scan output of terminal
if scan is 0 end for
end for loop

if count is 0 
print nothing to compute and return 0 to main

print average of even digits with,calc_averages passthrough
print average of odd digits with, calc_averages passthrough

return 0 in program


Main End ----------------------




calc_averages -------------------- return float

passthrough numbers and opperation

make int called count = 0
make int opperationc_count = 0
make int sum = 0

if opperation is even 
    while number at index count does not equal 0
        and number at index is module 2 equal to 0
            add to sum
            increase operation count by one
        close
        count ++
    close
close
else if the opperation is odd
    same logic as if opperation was even with the only change being module 2 does not equal 0


return the casted type of (float sum ) devided by opperation count
